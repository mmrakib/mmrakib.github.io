## Introduction

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks provide a more intuitive and functional approach to managing component logic, making code more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain.

In this post, we'll delve deeper into one of the most fundamental Hooksâ€”`useState`. We'll explore its usage, underlying mechanics, and how it seamlessly integrates state management into functional components. Additionally, we'll incorporate mathematical concepts to illustrate the efficiency and elegance Hooks bring to React development.

## useState

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components. Before Hooks, state management was exclusive to class components, which often led to more verbose and less intuitive code. With `useState`, you can manage state directly within your functional components, promoting cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

### Basic Usage

At its core, `useState` allows you to declare a state variable and a function to update that state. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialize count to 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

Now for some maths:

$$x = 5 + x - 2(7 \times x \times 5)$$
